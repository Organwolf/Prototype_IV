Thoughts and possible improvements

A function called create points should return a point/gameobject.
CreateClickPointObject(Touch touch) shouldn't create a quad.
TogglePlaneDetection and other helper functions could be added to a helper class.
Add a minimum distance for drawing a line?

Can I use this code to solve parts of the movement problem?

if(touch.phase == TouchPhase.Began)
{
    // might need to use the ARCamera instead. We'll see
    Ray ray = arCamera.ScreenPointToRay(touch.position);
    RaycastHit hitObject;

    if(Physics.Raycast(ray, out hitObject))
    {
        if(hitObject.transform.name.Contains("PlacedObject"))
        {
            onTouchHold = true;
        }
    }
}
