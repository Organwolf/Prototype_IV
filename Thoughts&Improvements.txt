Thoughts and possible improvements

A function called create points should return a point/gameobject.
CreateClickPointObject(Touch touch) shouldn't create a quad.
TogglePlaneDetection and other helper functions could be added to a helper class.
Add a minimum distance for drawing a line?

Can I use this code to solve parts of the movement problem?

if(touch.phase == TouchPhase.Began)
{
    // might need to use the ARCamera instead. We'll see
    Ray ray = arCamera.ScreenPointToRay(touch.position);
    RaycastHit hitObject;

    if(Physics.Raycast(ray, out hitObject))
    {
        if(hitObject.transform.name.Contains("PlacedObject"))
        {
            onTouchHold = true;
        }
    }
}

The code used for snapping object together should be moved to a seperate function. Both for 
readability and encapsulation(?). Also the raycasting might be able to consolidate. Now it is done
multiple times. It might be possible to do it once and use that hitinfo inside of the if/else if 
statements.
